# Data Types 
# We have different types of data types in python

# Text Type:	str
# Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
# None Type:	NoneType
# Boolean Type:	bool


# ----- learn it later with other concepts ---------
# Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
# Mapping Type:	dict
# Set Types:	set, frozenset
# Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview


#1.  Numberic Types:	int, float, complex
    
    # int 
        # int is interger so you might have read it from maths to all the negative to postive numbers are the interger
        # e.x. -1,0,1,2,3...... -2,-3,-4
        
    # float
        # float is basically decimal so it only holds decimal values
        # ex.  -1.0,1.0,0.0 so on

    # complex numbers 
        # the same thing as math so if a number has real and imaginery part with it it is complex
        # ex. 1j 3i 
    
# 2. Boolean Types: bool
    # bool mean True or False.
    # ex. True, False
    #  are you above 18? -> either True or False
    
# 3. Text Types: str
    # str is basically string so it can hold any kind of data. it should be either inside ' here anything is considerd as text' or "1234 it is text "
    # ex. "hello", "world"

# 4. None Type: None
    # None is a special type of data type that is used to represent null values. (null,empty,Nothing).
    # data nai hold gardaina kei xaina vane None lekhne bujhyou?


#  Now comes Variable declarations


# name:cast = his values  yesari variable banainxa

# some rules before
    # 1. variable name ma bich ma space huna hunna if space chianxa vane 
        # use underscore or camelCase
        # e.g my_name_is or myNameIs 
    # 2. variable ko data type
        # decimal_number: int = 2.0 (this is wrong)
        # decimal_number: float = 2.0 (this is correct)
    
# integer -> int
# string -> str
# decimal -> float
# boolean -> bool

first_name:str = "Name"
middle_name:str = None
last_name:str = "Name"
email:str = "name@gmail.com"
permanent_address:str = ""
date_of_birth:str = ""
